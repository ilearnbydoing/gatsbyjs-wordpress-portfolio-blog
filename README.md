## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a Gatsby project.

    .
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ node_modules
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ static
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .gitignore
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gatsby-config.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ yarn.lock
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ siteConfig.js
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .wordpress-config.json
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/static`**: This directory will contain all of the static files required by theme such as `favicon`, `logo` and `robot.txt`.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

5.  **`yarn.lock`** (See `yarn.lock` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won‚Äôt change this file directly).**

6.  **`siteConfig`**: A config file for your website, which includes things like website url, title, Background color, theme color etc.

7.  **`.wordpress-config.json`**: A config file containing config required to fetch data from wordpress such as url and content keys etc.

8.  **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.

## Configure

```js
//siteConfig.js
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: "https://wp-balsa-preview.draftbox.co", // Site domain. Do not include a trailing slash!

  postsPerPage: 10, // Number of posts shown on paginated pages (changes this requires sometimes to delete the cache)

  siteTitleMeta: "Built with Draftbox", // This allows an alternative site title for meta data for pages.
  siteDescriptionMeta: "New-age blogging platform", // This allows an alternative site description for meta data for pages.

  shareImageWidth: 1000, // Change to the width of your default share image
  shareImageHeight: 523, // Change to the height of your default share image

  backgroundColor: "#e9e9e9", // Used for Offline Manifest
  themeColor: "#15171A", // Used for Offline Manifest
  apiUrl: "https://wordpress.theasdfghjkl.com",

    helpText: "Get the latest posts delivered right to your inbox.",
    successMessage: "Thanks for subscribing to Draftbox.",
  },
  header: {
    navigation: [
      {
        label: "Home",
        url: "https://wp-gatsbyjs.netlify.app/",
      },

      },
      {
        label: "Sitemap",
        url: "https://wp-gatsbyjs.netlify.app/sitemap.xml",
      },
      {
        label: "RSS",

      },
      {
        label: "Contact",

      },
      {
        label: "External Link",
        url: "https://spectrum.chat/gatsby-js/themes?tab=posts",
      },
    ],
  },
  socialLinks: {
    twitter: "https://twitter.com/draftboxhq",
    facebook: "https://facebook.com/",
    instagram: "https://www.instagram.com/",
    linkedin: "https://linkedin.com/",
    github: "https://github.com/draftbox-co",
  },
  contactWidget: {
    title: "Contact Built with Draftbox",
    successMessage: "We‚Äôll get in touch with you soon.",
  },
};
```

In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `siteUrl`, `siteTitleMeta` and `siteDescriptionMeta`. Update at least those to fit your needs.

## WordPress Content configuration

```bash
    {
        "baseUrl": "yourwordpressblog.com",
        "protocol": "https",
        "hostingWPCOM": false,
        "useACF": true,
        "includedRoutes": [
            "**/categories",
            "**/posts",
            "**/pages",
            "**/media",
            "**/tags",
            "**/taxonomies",
            "**/users"
        ]
    }
```

In the configuration shown above, the most important fields to be changed are `baseUrl` and `hostingWPCOM` . Update those with your configuration. example shown above works great for self hosted wordpress.

If your blog is hosted on wordpress.com you will have to add few extra keys for reference check out [wordpress-source-docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/).

## Deploy

```bash
    gatsby build
```

After completion of the build process your static site can be found in the `public/` folder. Copy those files over to your webserver.
